# If cobbler is behind a proxy for  download from internet , the http_proxy settings in environment doesn't help
# to complete the installation . It fails during "cobbler get-loaders " tasks . Proxy has to be explicitly 
#mentioned in the /etc/cobbler/settings file . Hence modified the template and inserting this additional var
